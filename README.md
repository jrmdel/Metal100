# Metal100

This study was part of a school project. We had to find a dataset and extract valuable information from it. We chose a dataset that contains the top 100 metal albums of all time (according to The Rolling Stone Magazine) that we found on data.world : https://data.world/kcmillersean/rs-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time

These data were retrieved via the Spotify API. At this date, the API provides even more information such as the liveness of a song, the speechiness of a song or even the mode. Further analysis could be done thanks to that.

Here is our analysis, written in French.
